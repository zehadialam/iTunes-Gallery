# iTunes Gallery App

## Description
This is GUI application that I built using JavaFX that displays a 4 x 5 grid of album covers based on a keyword search for an artist or music genre. The results are based on the query to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/index.html">iTunes Search API</a>. Java threads were used to keep the GUI responsive through user interaction.<br><br> 

This application was created for a software development class (CSCI 1302) at UGA. Since this is still an <a href="https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-gallery">actively assigned project for the course</a>, the source files are not included in this repository. An executable JAR file for the application is included. <br><br>

### Essential Tools Utilized
<ul> The Google GSON library was used to parse the JSON response from the iTunes Search API and extract album cover URLs </ul>
<ul> CSS was used for creating the various themes for the application </ul>
