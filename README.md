# iTunes Gallery App

This is GUI application that I built using JavaFX that displays a 4 x 5 grid of album covers based on a keyword search for an artist or music genre. The results are based on the query to the iTunes Search API. This was created for a software development class (CSCI 1302) at UGA. Since this is still an actively assigned project for the course, the source files are not included in this repository. An executable JAR file for the application is included.
